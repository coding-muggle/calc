# Calc

# JavaScript Calculator

## Project Overview

This is a web-based calculator application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations with a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **Clear Functionality**: Reset the calculator with a clear button
- **Decimal Support**: Handle floating-point numbers
- **Error Handling**: Manage division by zero and other edge cases
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Installation

- Clone the repository
- Open index.html in your web browser

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Page structure and semantic elements
- **CSS3** - Styling, layout, and responsive design
- **JavaScript** - Calculator logic and interactivity
- **Flexbox/Grid** - Modern CSS layout techniques

## How to Use

1. **Basic Operations**:
   - Click number buttons (0-9) to input numbers
   - Click operation buttons (+, -, ×, ÷) to select operations
   - Press `=` or Enter to calculate the result
   - Use `C` to clear the display
   - Use ⌫ to remove last digit

2. **Keyboard Support**:
   - Numbers: 0-9
   - Operations: +, -, *, /
   - Calculate: Enter or =
   - Clear: Escape or Delete

## Key JavaScript Concepts Implemented

- Event listeners for button interactions
- DOM manipulation for display updates
- Arithmetic operation functions
- Input validation and error handling
- State management for calculator operations

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Operation Chaining**: Implemented state tracking for consecutive operations
- **UI/UX**: Designed intuitive button layout with visual feedback
- **Edge Cases**: Handled division by zero and maximum input length

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add keyboard support for all operations
- [ ] Implement memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
- [ ] Add scientific calculator features
- [ ] Include theme switcher (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Add calculation history display
- [ ] Implement percentage calculations
- [ ] Add sound effects for button presses
